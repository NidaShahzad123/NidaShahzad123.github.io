         <pre class="text143">Electro Unplugged - A Twist of Acoustics</pre>
         <p class="text144">By Kat Farrell
          <br>
          <br>
          After a high-voltage rampage through the city alongside Spider-Man,
          <br>
          Electro was apprehended and transferred to a specially designed cell 
          <br>
          at the Raft. To ensure maximum security, prison officials took extensive
          <br>
          precautions with their newly acquired electrifying inmate. According 
          <br>
          to insider information, the cell is reminiscent of a scene from a science fiction movie. Enclosed by PVC pipe-bars that are non-conductive and featuring rubber
          flooring, Electro is effectively neutralized, unable to generate even the slightest static shock. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This containment arrangement brings relief to the once-fearful citizens, as Electro will now serve 
          his sentence in a low-power mode, minimizing any potential threats.</p>

        <p class="text147">By Ben Urich
          <br>
          <br>
          Mayor Norman Osborn Announces
          <br>
           Third Mayoral Campaign
          <br>
          <br>
          In an unexpected move, Mayor Norman
          <br> 
          Osborn has revealed his intention
          <br> 
          to seek a third term as Mayor of the
          <br>
          city. This decision comes after the 
          <br>
          City Council passed a bill, which was
          <br>
          spearheaded by Mayor Osborn, eliminating
          <br>
          term limits for the Mayor's Office. With
          <br>
          this new development, Osborn has been 
          <br>
          given the opportunity to pursue an 
          <br>
          unprecedented third consecutive term
          <br>
          in office.
          <br>
          <br>
          Speaking to the press, Osborn confidently 
          <br>
          stated, "Under my leadership, the city
          <br>
          has experienced remarkable progress and
          <br>
          growth. I firmly believe that by securing
          <br>
          another term, we can accomplish even greater
          <br>
          feats together." 
          <br>
          <br>
          The Mayor's optimism resonated with
          <br>
          the public, particularly as he emphasized
          <br>
          his commitment to enhancing citywide 
          <br>
          security. One of his key objectives 
          <br>
          is to reduce the city's reliance on
          <br>
          masked vigilantes, such as the controversial
          <br> 
          figure known as the Spider-Menace. Osborn
          <br>
          aims to achieve this by providing 
          <br>
          increased support to the overburdened
          <br>
          police force and implementing a range
          <br>
          of other initiatives.
          <br>
          <br>
          Considering the Mayor's track record
          <br>
          and his ambitious agenda, there is 
          <br>
          anticipation surrounding the potential
          <br>
          success of his administration if granted
          <br>
          a third term. As the campaign unfolds,
          <br>
          the public eagerly speculates whether
          <br>
          this third term will be the catalyst
          <br>
          for further accomplishments under Mayor
          <br>
          Osborn's leadership.

          The Daily Bugle Bids Farewell to Longtime Publisher J. Jonah Jameson
          <br>
          <br>
          In a bittersweet announcement, The 
           
          <br> 
          Daily Bugle has announced the departure
          <br> 
          of its esteemed publisher, J. Jonah Jameson. 
          <br>
          After an illustrious career spanning
          <br>
          decades, the tenacious and outspoken 
          <br>
          journalist is redirecting his energy
          <br>
          toward the world of podcasts.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout his remarkable tenure,
          <br>
          Jameson played a pivotal role in 
          <br>
          shaping The Daily Bugle into New York City's
          <br>
          foremost newspaper, renowned for
          <br>
          its hard-hitting reporting that 
          <br>
          fearlessly exposed the truths often
          <br>
          overlooked by other publications. 
          <br>
          His unwavering commitment to compelling
          <br>
          journalism garnered him numerous 
          <br>
          prestigious national awards and even 
          <br>
          a highly coveted book deal.
          <br>
          <br>
          While bidding farewell to his position
          <br>
          as publisher, Jameson remains resolute

        Next to the word “monopoly” is a picture of Wilson Fisk,
        <br>
        CEO of Fisk Construction.His cranes dominate the skylines
        <br>
        while his branded steel beams support the skeletons of the
        <br>
        majority of NYC’s highest skyscrapers. Since the city is essentially
        <br>
        his, Fisk looks overseas to expand his empire.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some worry about his global aspirations, but who cares when he
        <br>
        single-handedly rescued our middle-class, blue-collar workers?
        <br>
        Hundreds of once-unemployed New Yorkers now work, while businesses
        <br> 
        worldwide flock for space at any of Fisk’s commercial towers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fisk is so successful, he even pours his own earnings back into new
        <br>
        projects. While this sounds shady, it’s better when a self-made mogul
        <br>
        self-finances in lieu of using taxpayer dollars.
        <br>
        <br>
        He can grow his company across oceans and worlds, if he wants. With so
        <br>
        much of the NYC skyline influenced by the mogul, this is Fisk’s world.
        <br>
        We’re just living in — or,in reality, renting — it.</p>

          Bryan I., Manhattan:
          <br>
          "I speculate that he could be an individual with a background in the
          <br>
          circus, longing for the exhilaration of the trapeze. His ability to 
          <br>
          effortlessly swing from building to building suggests a deep familiarity
          <br>
          with acrobatics."

          <br>
          James S., the Bronx:
          <br>
          "While I'm uncertain about his identity, I have a firm belief about what
          <br>
          he represents: a lawbreaker. If Spider-Man truly fights on the side of
          <br>
          justice, he should reveal his true face. Otherwise, he's no different 
          <br>
          from the masked criminals he apprehends."

          <br>
          Jacinda C., Midtown: "Ugh, my assumption is that he's likely an avid

          <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            A series of high-profile robberies targeting the wealthy
            <br>
            residents of New York City has left law enforcement baffled.
            <br>
            The audacity of the crimes suggests a perpetrator well-versed
            <br>
            in intricate home security systems typically associated with 
            <br>
            art museums and high-end jewelers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Authorities are grappling with the absence of substantial leads,
            <br>
            unable to determine whether the burglaries are the work of a solitary
            <br>
            thief or an organized criminal network.Confidential sources indicate 
            <br>
            that the culprit consistently leaves a distinct signature at each crime
            <br>
            scene, reinforcing suspicions that this is no ordinary criminal targeting 
            <br>
            the city's affluent.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pressure mounts on the police to solve the case as the city's wealthiest
            <br>
            families demand justice. In the event of continued failure, some victims
            <br>
            are contemplating seeking external assistance to unmask and apprehend the
            <br>
            elusive thief responsible for these multi-million-dollar heists.</p>
